                Style genie is here for you to test out random possible
                combinations of clothes in your wardrobe you might not have
                though of yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can also provide as a great source of inspiration to wear the
                items you've neglected for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly: it's a needed tool for those groggy mornings
                where you stare at your bursting wardrobe, think to yourself
                that you have 'nothing to wear' and just lack the willpower to
                decide.
            </p>
